## [nhk2021_ilias](https://github.com/KeioRoboticsAssociation/nhk2021_ilias)

Codes and simulator for NHK Robocon 2021. 

I created a urdf model of a 4 wheel steering robot, using the method to rotate joints on Gazebo by ROS Topic. I also created a precise and rotatable field model by converting a 3D CAD field to sdf. 

This repository may provide expertise in simulator construction.
