## [nav2_dynamic_window_pure_pursuit_controller](https://github.com/Decwest/nav2_dynamic_window_pure_pursuit_controller)

Nav2 plugin for Dynamic Window Pure Pursuit (DWPP) controller.

DWPP is a novel extension of the Pure Pursuit method that computes command velocities while considering the robot‚Äôs velocity and acceleration constraints. I first proposed this method at IAS-19 ([news](https://decwest.github.io/news/italy2025/)).

I also presented this work at ROSCon JP 2025 (in Japanese).

## [robot_simulator_template](https://github.com/Decwest/robot_simulator_template)

This repository contains some urdfs of robot components for robot simulation in gazebo, such as 2D/3D LiDAR, RGBD camera and mobile base.

## [nhk2021_ilias](https://github.com/KeioRoboticsAssociation/nhk2021_ilias)

Codes and simulator for NHK Robocon 2021. 

I created a urdf model of a 4 wheel steering robot, using the method to rotate joints on Gazebo by ROS Topic. I also created a precise and rotatable field model by converting a 3D CAD field to sdf. 

This repository may provide expertise in simulator construction.
